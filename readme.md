#I chose to use:

* No JavaScript Framework as I felt that for such a simple app that I would a Framework would be overkill.
* I would consider writing everything in ES6 JavaScript was modern.
* I used webpack to bundle the code and give the app a single entry point where the new instance is invoked.
* Tests were written in Jest and I only tested the data js file due to time constraint, I would normally have 100% coverage.

nmp install
npm run test
npm run server

ES6 stable code so that the code does not need to be transpiled to run on Chrome 54.
SASS for compiling CSS as I feel it is the industry standard right now.
HTML5 and CSS3 standards have been followed.
